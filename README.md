# wookiee-macbook-setup
Set of scripts or commands I use to setup my Macbook for development. Eventually, this all could be part of an Ansible playbook and executed from there. But baby steps!


# Setup

### Upgrade MacOS Terminal

1) Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
